This program reads in .csv data from 384 well plates read for Luciferase signal by an automated plate reader #The program reads in both a experimental plate (BGplate) and a control plate (CTGplate) #The values are normalized respectively and then a ratio is calculated that represents the sample's overall signal fold induction
